#### Workshop objectives ####

Grasping and manipulating a range of different objects in unstructured environments is one of the central challenges in robotics today. Traditional approaches and assumptions have been effective in working with known objects and constructed environments. But these may be limited as robots take on more novel challenging jobs in the real-world, where robots may be required to work through object uncertainties and environment disturbances, or complete objectives requiring extensive dexterity, speed, or efficiency that are not accomplished with existing gripper architectures or robot manipulation motion primitives. Augmenting a robotâ€™s ability to grasp and manipulate outside of these predefined tasks requires unconventional strategies in the end-effector design, planning and control methods, and tackling of novel environments and objects. 

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in the following areas: 
- Innovative robot hand topologies and materials (active surfaces, novel actuation, parallel mechanisms and more)
- Unusual methods and approaches (extrinsic forces, dynamic motions, varying contacts and more)
- Affecting uncommon objects (that may be deformable, flexible, or active), or operating in atypical environments (such as underwater, aerial, dense clutters, and more)

The goal of this workshop is to appreciate the shortcomings of traditional approaches in grasping and manipulation, and recognize opportunities offered by the unconventional strategies that have proven effective in the aforementioned research areas. Panelists and speakers will discuss where specific challenges lie in future robot manipulation applications, present ideas based on  systems developed to address some of these challenges, and the prospective areas that warrant further exploration.
